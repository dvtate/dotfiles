# dotfiles
Customization files for my Arch Linux computer(s).

I primarily use GNOME without a huge ammoung of customization. However I do occasionally use tiling WM's and I like to customize programs I use frequently, and frequent https://GNOME-look.org . Howevever I'm generally comfortable with the setup I have, and I don't like to change things much.

# Images
I recognize that github has scaled my images to save space, if you would like a higher resolution version open an issue and I'll send you the file.
